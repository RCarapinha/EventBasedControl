## Laboratory 4

The fourth task was to control two robots in an open space and making sure they donâ€™t collide, to help with the collision control we have a controller that gives permission to the robots.

## Laboratory 5

The fifth task is to develop a controller that manipulates one transport robot and 5 machines, each one with different execution times. Each machine has an input and an output buffer.
